At Pray Without Ceasing, we are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our mobile application handles information when you use our services.
1. Information We Collect
Pray Without Ceasing is designed to respect user privacy. We do not require you to create an account or provide personal information such as your name, email address, or phone number to use the basic features of the app.
Local Data: We store your prayer favorites, streak counts, and "last prayer" timestamps directly on your device using local storage. This data stays on your phone and is not transmitted to our servers.
Usage Data: We may collect anonymous technical data (such as device type and OS version) to improve app performance.
2. Third-Party Services
Our app utilizes third-party services to provide core functionality:
Google Gemini API: To generate daily prayers, the app sends the current date and seasonal context to Google's AI services. No personally identifiable information (PII) is sent with these requests.
Google AdMob: If enabled, AdMob may collect device identifiers and usage data to serve personalized or non-personalized advertisements. You can manage your ad preferences through your Android device settings.
Browser Notifications: If you opt-in for "Faith Streaks," we use your device's native notification system to send reminders. We do not track when you click these notifications on our servers.
3. Data Retention
Since your prayer data (favorites and streaks) is stored locally on your device, it will remain there until you either clear your app cache or uninstall the application. Once deleted, this data cannot be recovered by Ziri Corporation.
4. Children’s Privacy
Our app is a spiritual companion intended for a general audience. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If we become aware that a child has provided us with personal data, we will take steps to delete such information immediately.
5. Your Rights
You have the right to:
Clear your local data at any time through your device settings.
Opt-out of notifications at any time.
Reset your Advertising ID in your Android settings to limit ad tracking.
6. Changes to This Policy
Ziri Corporation may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the app.
